Q.1 Whatâ€™s difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous?

Ans Synchronous operations occur sequentially and block further execution until they complete, while asynchronous operations allow for concurrent execution and do not block subsequent code, typically using callbacks, promises, or async/await.


Q.2 What are Web Apis ?

Ans Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and tools provided by web browsers to interact with web features, such as accessing and manipulating HTML elements, making HTTP requests, and handling browser events.

Q.3 Explain SetTimeOut and setInterval ?

Ans setTimeout is a JavaScript function that executes a callback function after a specified delay (in milliseconds). It triggers the function only once.
setInterval is similar but repeatedly executes the callback function at a specified interval until cleared or stopped.

Q.4 how can you handle Async code in JavaScript ?



In JavaScript, you can handle asynchronous code using techniques such as callbacks, promises, and async/await. Callbacks allow you to pass functions as arguments to be executed after asynchronous operations complete. Promises provide a more structured approach for handling async operations, while async/await simplifies async code using asynchronous functions and the await keyword.
