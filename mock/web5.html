Explain what is execution context in detail with diagram




An execution context is a concept in JavaScript that defines the environment in which a piece of code is executed. It consists of three main components:

Variable Environment: Stores variables and function declarations.
Lexical Environment: Contains variables and functions in the current scope.
This Binding: Refers to the object that the current code is being executed on.

└── This Binding
The Variable Environment holds variables and function declarations, including the function's arguments and locally declared variables. It also stores hoisted variables and functions.

The Lexical Environment represents the current scope and contains variables defined within that scope, including block-scoped variables, function expressions, and arrow functions.

The This Binding refers to the object that the current code is operating on. It can be explicitly set using call(), apply(), or bind(), or it is determined by how a function is called (e.g., as a method, with new, or globally).
